# **Welcome to My Linux Learning Hub**

Welcome to my little corner of the web, built using Hugo with the Lotus Docs theme. But while this site runs on Hugo, it’s not just about Hugo—it’s about Linux, open-source tools, and the journey of learning. If you’re new to Linux, you’re in the right place.

## **How This Site Started**

Like many beginners, I found Linux exciting but sometimes overwhelming. I’d tinker, break things, fix them (or try to), and take notes along the way. I started using Hugo, a powerful static site generator, to document my learning process, but my first attempt was frustrating. I picked a theme that was too complex for a beginner, and I quickly hit a wall.

Then, I heard about **Lotus Docs** on a podcast called **LinuxCast**. One of the hosts, Drew, mentioned it as a terrific documentation-based Hugo theme. That was the nudge I needed. With a little help from my AI assistant—who I call Chad—I switched themes, started uploading my notes, and suddenly, everything clicked.

## **Why This Site Exists**

This site is my way of organizing and sharing what I learn about Linux, from setting up servers to troubleshooting issues and finding the best open-source tools. If you’re on your own Linux journey, I hope these articles help you, too.

I’ve also discovered a handy workflow: I take notes during my learning sessions, often with Chad’s help, summarize them, and convert them into Markdown files for easy publishing. It’s a simple but effective way to build a personal knowledge base—and now, I’m sharing it with you.

## **What You'll Find Here**

While this site is built with Hugo and Lotus Docs, the real focus is **Linux**. Expect to find:

* **Step-by-step guides** for Linux beginners  
* **Tips and troubleshooting** for common issues  
* **Markdown workflows** for note-taking and documentation  
* **Explorations of open-source software** that make Linux even better

This isn’t just a blog—it’s a growing documentation hub shaped by real-world learning and experience.

So, whether you’re setting up your first Linux server, tweaking your desktop environment, or trying to understand Markdown, I hope you find something useful here.

**Welcome aboard, and happy learning\!**
